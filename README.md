# AirBnB Clone Project

## Description

The AirBnB Clone Project is a simplified version of the real [AirBnB Website](https://www.airbnb.com/), aimed at learning full-stack web development. The project includes a web static interface, a dynamic website with a RESTful API, a MySQL database for persistence, and a command-line interpreter (CLI) to manage the backend data and objects.

This project is organized in multiple steps, focusing on building a modular, flexible, and scalable application. It emphasizes understanding how data is handled from backend to frontend, object-relational mapping, RESTful APIs, and web templating.
