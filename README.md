# HBnB - An AirBnB Clone Project (v1)

## Description

The AirBnB Clone Project is a simplified version of the real [AirBnB Website](https://www.airbnb.com/), aimed at learning full-stack web development. The project includes a web static interface, a dynamic website with a RESTful API, a MySQL database for persistence, and a command-line interpreter (CLI) to manage the backend data and objects.

This project is organized in multiple steps, focusing on building a modular, flexible, and scalable application. It emphasizes understanding how data is handled from backend to frontend, object-relational mapping, RESTful APIs, and web templating.

This first step (version) consists of a custom command-line interface for data management, and the base classes for the storage of this data.

## Features

- **Command Interpreter (CLI)** to create and manage different objects (Users, Places, etc.).
- **Object serialization and deserialization** to JSON for file storage and MySQL for persistent storage.
- **Dynamic web content** using Python and HTML/CSS.
- **RESTful APIs** for interaction with frontend clients.
- **Unit tests** for verifying correctness of models and storage engine.
